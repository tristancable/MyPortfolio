                <h3>General Information:</h3>
                <p>I've been a Utah resident since birth, born on 
                    February 14th, 2005. Since childhood, my fascination 
                    with computers and technology has been evident. This 
                    passion has steered me towards a career in technology. 
                    Currently, in 2023, I'm enrolled at Neumont College of 
                    Computer Science, where I delve deep into coding and 
                    constantly strive to expand my coding prowess.
                </p>

                <h3>Interests:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Cars:</h4>
                        I have a strong affinity for JDM (Japanese
                        Domestic Market) cars, with the Mazda RX7 FD3S
                        ranking as my favorite among them.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Motorcycles/Dirt bikes:</h4>
                        I own a Honda CRF150R dirt bike and plan to buy a
                        motorcycle eventually.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Snowboarding:</h4>
                        I've been snowboarding for quite a while now and
                        would consider myself at an intermediate to
                        advanced level.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Video Games:</h4>
                        I would say Cyberpunk 2077 ranks as my favorite
                        game, closely followed by Warzone, as my friends
                        and I enjoy playing it together.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Movies/Anime:</h4>
                        My top movie series is definitely Harry Potter,
                        while my favorite anime would probably be Attack
                        on Titan.
                    </li>
                </ul>
